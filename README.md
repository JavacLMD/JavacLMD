# Welcome!
I am Lane Dorscher. Self-proclaimed intermediate programmer with fundamental knowledge on coding and practices. Always striving to increase my skillset and understanding of the technological world.

## About Me
Huge fan of the Sci-FI genre. My favorites include shows like Star Trek: The Next Generation and Voyager. My favorite games are the Mass Effect Trilogy and Apex Legends.
I'm an admirer of the Medieval genre. I admire medival armor and weapons. Swords are pretty cool. My absolute favorite movie is A Knight's Tale for what comedy it has but the message it conveys about creating your own path.

## Education and Experiences
Graduated from high school in 2016 and went straight to college the following year, graduating from Iowa Western Community College with an Associates Degree in Computer Science. I expected to transfer to a university but opted not too for financial reasons. I spent my time working full time in a grocery store before working in a factory until I applied for a job at Revature and started in July 2021. I spent my free time in that period as a hobbiest working on my own personal game project where I experimented with C#.
